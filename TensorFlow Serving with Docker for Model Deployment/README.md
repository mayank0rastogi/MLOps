In this Project I will learn how to train and export TensorFlow models for text classification, learn how to deploy models with TF Serving and Docker in 90 seconds, and build simple {gRPC} and {REST-based} clients in Python for model inference.





### Following tasks in the project:
```

Task 1: Load and Preprocess the Amazon Fine Foods Review Data

Task 2: Build Text Classification Model using Keras and TensorFlow Hub

Task 3: Define Training Procedure

Task 4: Train and Export Model as Protobuf

Task 5: Test Model

Task 6: TensorFlow Serving with Docker

Task 7: Setup a REST Client to Perform Model Predictions

Task 8: Setup a gRPC Client to Perform Model Predictions

Task 9: Versioning with TensorFlow Serving

```
